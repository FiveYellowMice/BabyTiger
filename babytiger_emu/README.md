An "emulator" of BabyTiger written with SDL 2. I thought writing games would be easier if I write them for PC first and then port it to the actual hardware so I wrote this. I didn't end up making any games for Baby Tiger though, so this thing end up being just a stripped down game of Snake. It should compile on Linux and macOS with SDL 2 installed.
